What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory efficiency of different data structures (vector, hash table, BST) when loading and searching course data. In Project Two, I built a program that reads course information from a file and prints the course list in alphanumeric order, using a hash table to store the data.

How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important?
I approached the problem by first understanding how each data structure stores and retrieves information. Data structures are essential because they determine how efficiently we can manage and access data. For example, vectors are simple to use but not ideal for frequent lookups, while hash tables offer fast access but can be complex to implement correctly.

How did you overcome any roadblocks?
One of the main challenges I faced was reading and parsing the input file correctly and making sure all course dependencies were mapped properly. I used debugging, visual output, and reading documentation to figure out where my logic was off and fixed it through trial and error.

How has this project expanded your approach to software design and development?
These projects helped me better understand how design decisions impact performance. Instead of defaulting to familiar structures, I learned to evaluate what's best for the job based on time complexity and space trade-offs.

How has it changed the way you write programs?
I now pay more attention to writing clean, maintainable code. That means clearer function names, consistent indentation, and organizing logic into small reusable functions. I also write with future updates in mind, so my code is easier to adapt.
